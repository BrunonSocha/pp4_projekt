# Possible things to do
## Controllers
- Different services for each controller to take out the business logic from them (consult with Pawe≈Ç)
- Cart controller [x]
    - Needs remodelling after adding a cartId instead of checking carts depending on the userId
- Login controller

## Tests
- In general

## Models
- Add User, change Cart to have its own ID and have user ID as an FK
